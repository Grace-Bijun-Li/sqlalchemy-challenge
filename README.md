# sqlalchemy-challenge

## Introduction
Welcome to the new SQL challenge! In here, an advanced SQLAlchemy analysis is done to look through and manipulate climate data in Hawaii. Imagine you are treating yourself a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, and here this analysis will help you get prepared with a nice weather plan!

## Instruction
There are three components of this analysis:

1. [data folder](https://github.com/Grace-Bijun-Li/sqlalchemy-challenge/tree/main/data)
    - This is the raw data file that contains the climate data in Hawaii over the years. In the analysis, the **hawaii.sqlite** file was mainly used to perform the query and further analysis with.
2. [climate_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/Grace-Bijun-Li/sqlalchemy-challenge/blob/main/climate_analysis.ipynb) 
    - This is the main script where the SQLAlchemy analysis is done. In here, we not only query for the weather data, but also perform the statistical calculations of the weather in Hawaii using hypothetical trip dates.
3. [app.py](https://github.com/Grace-Bijun-Li/sqlalchemy-challenge/blob/main/app.py)
    - This is an additional application using the Flask API tool. By integrating the SQLAlchemy knowledge with Flask, you are now able to run the query the climate data (and stats) directly from your terminal and query from your localhost!
